            <Timeline.Title>What is 'cors'?</Timeline.Title>
            <Timeline.Body>
              Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based
              mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain,
              scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should
              permit loading resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which
              browsers make a "preflight" request to the server hosting the
              cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will
              permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends
              headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be
              used in the actual request.

              Why are you using 'firebase'? What other options do you have to
              implement authentication?
            </Timeline.Title>
            <Timeline.Body>
              Google Firebase offers many features that pitch it as the go-to
              backend development tool for web and mobile apps. It reduces
              development workload and time. And it's a perfect prototyping
              tool. Firebase is simple, lightweight, friendly, and industrially
              recognized.Indeed, Firebase is a less technical and time-saving
              alternative to writing full-fledged backend code for dynamic apps.
              You might also want to consider leveraging this tool if you
              eventually wish to host and manage your app in the cloud. Being
              serverless, Firebase removes the need to worry about the
              technicalities of cloud server configuration.
              <br />
              As a Google Cloud service, it also gives you access to other
              Google products and features, like Google Drive and Sheets. For
              instance, you can import dummy data from Google Sheets and use it
              temporarily to serve your app.

            <Timeline.Title>How does the private route work?</Timeline.Title>
            <Timeline.Body>
              Private Routes in React Router (also called Protected Routes)
              require a user being authorized to visit a route (read: page). So
              if a user is not authorized for a specific page, they cannot
              access it. The most common example is authentication in a React
              application where a user can only access the protected pages when
              they are authorized (which means in this case being
              authenticated). Authorization goes beyond authentication though.
              For example, a user can also have roles and permissions which give
              a user access to specific areas of the application.

            <Timeline.Title>What is Node? How does Node work?</Timeline.Title>
            <Timeline.Body>
              Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript
              runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine (i.e. V8
              engine) and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which
              was designed to build scalable network applications. Node.js lets
              developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for
              server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce
              dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web
              browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript
              everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around
              a single programming language, rather than different languages for
              server-side and client-side scripts. Node.js has an event-driven
              architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim
              to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with
              many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web
              applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser
              games). The Node.js distributed development project was previously
              governed by the Node.js Foundation, and has now merged with the JS
              Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation, which is facilitated by
              the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.
